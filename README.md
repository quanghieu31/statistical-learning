All things related to statistical learning and data manipulation

- I read papers that I find useful and important, and then I try to re-implement some of them.
- I write takeaway notes from An Introduction to Statistical Learning (https://www.statlearning.com/), but now most of my notes are annotated directly in the PDF as I read. I plan to review and summarize them later for my own benefit.
- I also take notes from other readings and practices that I hope to remember in the long term.

All things related to statistical learning and data manipulation for machine learning and modeling projects

- Useful papers/methods, try to re-implement some of them
- Takeaway notes from An Introduction to Statistical Learning, most of my notes are annotated directly in the PDF book-- plan to review and summarize them later
- Practice implementing these techniques on toy data or Kaggle data

General classification models:
- Logistic regression
- LDA
- QDA
- KNN (non-parametric)

Classification models that are more specific and deserve more attention in separate directories:
- Tree-based
- SVM (multiclass classification = SVClassifier or One-vs-all or one-vs-one)

Multiclass $\neq$ multilabel
- multiclass => each instance has only class
- multilabel => each instance can have more than one label/class

Other than linear-oriented, matrix-based and stats-based techniques like Lasso regression, PCA or SHAP to reduce dimensionality of data, we also want to care about the relationships, correlations, visualizations, charts and so on of data before making any decisions.

Challenges:
- Not all the times that reduced dimension is good, what if redundant variables when combined then become good predictors
